## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use different flexbox properties and now i'm more comfortable using this tool. I learned some general properties applied to the
'*' selector. 

Some meaningful code snippets:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development
I will be keep learning about CSS Flexbox, i also want to learn about CSS Grid and responsive design. I'm barely starting
this journey, but i also want to learn JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [CSS properties](https://my-learning.w3schools.com/courses/?tut=css) - This website helped me to find different properties which made everything easier for me.
- [Kevin Powell - Conquering responsive layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This course helped a lot to learn flexbox. I truly recommend his youtube channel.
